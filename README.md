# Project Title: Data Visualization Task

## Overview
This project involves completing a series of tasks outlined below using the Jupyter Notebook named `data_viz_task.ipynb`. The tasks are based on analyzing the Cars93 dataset and answering questions provided within the notebook.

## Completed Tasks
I have successfully completed the following tasks as instructed in the notebook:

1. Generated box plots for the revs per mile for Audi, Hyundai, Suzuki, and Toyota manufacturers. Determined which manufacturer has the car with the highest revs per mile.
2. Created histograms of MPG in the city and on the highway. Analyzed whether it's generally more fuel-efficient to drive in the city or on the highway.
3. Plotted a line graph showing the relationship between 'Wheelbase' and 'Turning Circle'. Discussed the nature of this relationship and the impact of increasing wheelbase size.
4. Constructed a bar plot illustrating the mean horsepower for each car type (Small, Midsize, etc.). Investigated whether larger cars tend to have more horsepower.

## Usage
To replicate these tasks, simply open the Jupyter Notebook file `data_viz_task.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and execute the provided code cells.

## Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Future Improvements
Potential improvements for this project include:
- Adding more detailed analysis and insights to the task responses.
- Enhancing visualization aesthetics for better clarity and understanding.
- Exploring additional datasets for further analysis and comparison.
